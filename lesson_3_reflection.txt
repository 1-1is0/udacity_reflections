When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?




Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    i rather push when ever i've doen something, not in the middle

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
    branches are from same repo and work on that repo and so on ..........
    clone use for copying repo to any computer and start to make change on it, you should stil be able to push and pull to main repo
    fork is like copying someone project, push and pull are not going to work on repo you fork from
